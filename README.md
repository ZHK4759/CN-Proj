# 🚦 CN Project: Network Load Balancer

This project demonstrates a simple **Load Balancer** system using Python. It includes a **multi-threaded HTTP server**, a **load balancer** that distributes client requests, and a **client simulator** to generate test traffic.

---

## 🔧 Features

* ✅ **Multi-threaded HTTP Servers**
  Efficient handling of multiple client connections using Python's threading.

* 🎯 **Dynamic Load Balancing**
  Balances incoming traffic based on **active connections** for better performance.

* 🔄 **Simulated Load Testing with Retry Logic**
  Client simulation includes retry mechanisms for robust testing.

* 📈 **Enhanced Logging**
  Monitor system behavior with clear and informative logs.

## 📁 Project Structure

| File        | Description                                                  |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `server.py` | Starts a multi-threaded HTTP server that serves `100MB.bin`. |
| `load.py`   | Implements the load balancer and manages server connections. |
| `client.py` | Simulates client traffic to the load balancer.               |
| `100MB.bin` | A sample file served by the application servers.             |

---

## ✅ Prerequisites

* Python **3.7 or higher**
* `requests` library
  *(Install via `pip install requests`)*
* Linux / macOS / Windows terminal

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 🔹 Step 1: Setup

1. Clone this repository or download the project files.
2. Ensure the file `100MB.bin` is present in the same directory.

### 🔹 Step 2: Start Application Servers

Open a terminal and run:

```bash
python3 load.py 8001 8005
```

This will:

* Start the **load balancer on port 6000**
* Start **application servers** on ports `8001` to `8005`

### 🔹 Step 3: Simulate Client Requests

Open **another terminal** and run:

```bash
python3 client.py
```

This sends multiple HTTP requests to the load balancer, which then distributes them across the application servers.

---

## 📊 Example Output

Logs will show real-time request distribution, server response, and retry attempts (if any). Useful for monitoring and debugging load balancing behavior.

---

## 💡 Notes

* The project is designed for educational purposes and local testing.
* You can scale the number of servers by modifying the port range in `load.py`.
